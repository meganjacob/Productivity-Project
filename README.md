# Productivity-Project
This was my group's submission to Open Hacks, a hackathon that took place from May 23-24. 

Our goal was to increase productivity while people are being forced to work and learn from home while also preventing people from being over worked.

To do this we designed a chrome extension that allows people to set work goals and ensures that they are meeting those goals. When the program detects that the individual is losing focus they are prompted to take aa short break and directed to curated content that they can filter that is designed to maximize their break time for optimal mental health.
